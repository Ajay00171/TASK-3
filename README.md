The code you're running attempts to fetch the **Bank Marketing** dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository using the `fetch_ucirepo` function from the `ucimlrepo` library. Here's what each part of the code does:

1. **Fetching the dataset**:
   - `fetch_ucirepo(id=222)` is used to download the **Bank Marketing** dataset (UCI ID: 222).

2. **Extracting data**:
   - `X = bank_marketing.data.features` stores the features (independent variables) in `X` as a Pandas DataFrame.
   - `y = bank_marketing.data.targets` stores the target variable (dependent variable) in `y` as a Pandas DataFrame.

3. **Metadata**:
   - `print(bank_marketing.metadata)` prints the metadata about the dataset, such as the dataset's description, usage, and other attributes.

4. **Variable Information**:
   - `print(bank_marketing.variables)` prints information about the variables (features and target) in the dataset, including their names, types, and possible values.

However, this code relies on the `ucimlrepo` library and its `fetch_ucirepo` function, which might need to be installed first.

If you're trying to inspect this dataset and run analyses on it, please make sure you have the correct library installed. You can use:

```bash
pip install ucimlrepo
```

Once it's installed, you can run your code. Would you like to proceed with any specific analysis or visualization of the **Bank Marketing** dataset?
